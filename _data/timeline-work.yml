  description: During my 4-Year apprenticeship, I changed teams every year in order to get to know as many areas of IT as possible. 
               I did my final project in the Unix-Team of my Company. I deployed a high available containerized Prometheus-Monitoring-Stack,
               including Grafana, Thanos and Nginx.
