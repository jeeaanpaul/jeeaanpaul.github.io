## **About Me**
Hey my name is Jean-Paul :wave:, <br>
I'm a 20y old IT Apprentice from Switzerland. I am highly interested in technology, especially in the areas of cybersecurity, virtualization and linux.
- :student: Finishing my 4-Year Apprenticeship in August 2024.

I also do a lot of sports. I recently switched from playing volleyball :volleyball: (NLB) to bobsledding :sled:.  
I am currently part of the youth squad of SwissSliding and looking forward to join a professional bobsled-team soon.
